STM32L1_labs
============
This repository contains all the demo source code from the book. 3 lab works are necessarily and the fourth is at will

List of labs:
--------------

1. [The first project. Flashing diodes]
2. [Working with liquid crystal display (LCD)]
3. [Touch panel and interrupts]
4. Creating a game

Requirements
------------
Windows

To assume the correct work you have to use IAR Embedded Workbench. 

Linux

Unfortunately IAR isn't a port for Linux. If you are on Linux, use Eclipse and ARM toolchain or VirtualBox :)

Pull request information
---------

1. You have to add source file into folder of your group
2. You have to add filename extension! (.c, .txt, etc)

If you find a bug, [create a new issue]
